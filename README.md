# NordStock

Nordstock is a fun little web project I made for viewing daily stock data.<br />
I used MySql for database, AlphaVantage for stock API, React for frontend and Express for backend.

## Problemos

Site is not hosted. Stock API can only make 5 calls per minute or 500 per day, which will bug the site sometimes since <br />
calls will exceed 5 per minute.
